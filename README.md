# Calorie Burn Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to predict the number of calories burned during physical activities. The project aims to assist users in monitoring their calorie expenditure more accurately based on various factors such as age, weight, height, and activity duration.

## Project Overview

The Calorie Burn Prediction project leverages Python and several popular libraries to develop a predictive model. The dataset used in this project includes features like gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature. The project applies data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

### Key Features:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing data, outliers, and normalizing the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand relationships and trends.
- Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features that contribute most to the prediction.
- Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to train the model.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Files in the Repository

- `calorie_burn_prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions (this file).

## Results

The project successfully predicts the number of calories burned with reasonable accuracy. The Random Forest algorithm provided the best results among the tested models. The final model can be used to estimate calorie expenditure for new data inputs.

## Future Work

- Integrate the model into a web or mobile application for real-time calorie tracking.
- Experiment with more advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods or neural networks, to further improve prediction accuracy.
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse physical activities and demographic groups.
